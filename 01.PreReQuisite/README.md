## Pre Requisites 
Here are some basic problems that would would help in Brushing up the knowledge of DS & algo in cpp.

# 1.Even and Odd Indexes

Given an array of integers, print two integer values:
First, the sum of all numbers which are even as well as whose index are even.
Second, the sum of all numbers which are odd as well as whose index are odd.
Print the two integers space separated. (Arrays is 0-indexed)

# 3.PRE4
There are ‘n’ number of villages. You are given an array of size ‘n’ representing the population of each village. Every year, there is a cricket competition between two teams and villagers who come to see the match. Villagers from ith village and (n-i)-1th village (0 <= i < n/2) are combined and then formed groups of 10 people each. For e.g. villagers from villages 0 and n-1, 1 and n-2, 2 and n-3 are combined. The number of villages is always even. So, clearly there will be n/2 combinations from all the villages. You have to tell how many groups will be formed in each combination and how many villagers will be left without the complete group of 10 peoples.

# 4.Target Marbles

At CodingNinjas, we love to play with marbles. We have many marble games, but the most popular one is “Target Marbles”. Now, our marbles are unique. Each marble has a number on it.
In Target Marbles, the player is given a number in the starting and this number is called target. The player is also given N number of marbles to play with. Now, player has to arrange the marbles in a specific way such that sum of the values of at least one of the continuous subset of the arrangement is equal to given target.
Now, NinjaCoder came to play this game and made an arrangement of marbles. The judges of the game need your help. You have to determine if NinjaCoder has won it or not.There are ‘n’ number of villages. You are given an array of size ‘n’ representing the population of each village. Every year, there is a cricket competition between two teams and villagers who come to see the match. Villagers from ith village and (n-i)-1th village (0 <= i < n/2) are combined and then formed groups of 10 people each. For e.g. villagers from villages 0 and n-1, 1 and n-2, 2 and n-3 are combined. The number of villages is always even. So, clearly there will be n/2 combinations from all the villages. You have to tell how many groups will be formed in each combination and how many villagers will be left without the complete group of 10 peoples.

# 5.Oscillating Prices of "Chakri"
Diwali is here. While everyone here is busy texting "Happy Diwali" wishes to everybody else, NinjaCoder has some other plans and wants to earn some money this season.
Now, the Apex court has allowed the sale of only green crackers this Diwali. Out of all green crackers, "Chakri" is most popular. Because of the irregular supply of "Chakri", the price of "Chakri" is oscillating daily. NinjaCoder saw a business opportunity in this. He/She got a price list for coming N days from an insider in the market union. Prices in the list are for 1 unit of a large packet of "Chakri". Each large packet contains 100 units of Chakri.
Now, due to financial limitations, NinjaCoder can transact only 1 large packet (100 units of "Chakri") in the market. You have to tell maximum profit possible, given that he/she can transact atmost one time.<br>
